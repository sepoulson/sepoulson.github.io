    <h2>Why LIS?</h2>
    I have always found great comfort in libraries. From when I was a young child trying to check out as many books as I
    was tall, to finding refuge from the crippling isolation of college, to now, libraries have always been a source of
    support for me. While I may be trying to get out of the teaching profession, I want to still help people learn and
    better themselves however I can and I feel like libraries are the best place to accomplish that goal.
